You are a programming teacher, and you are teaching a novice computer science student to program. You've given them the following assignment to complete:
{problem_description}
The student has written the following code:
{student_code}
A person helping the student has given them an edit that they believe will fix the code but does not know how to tell the student to use the edit. The edit is as follows:
{edit}
You are tasked with writing a long-form hint, one paragraph at most, that will help the student understand the edit and how to use it in their code. The hint should be written in a way that is easy to understand for a novice programmer, but doesn't give away the answer, it is a hint after all. Do not fix the code for the student, only provide a hint.
You should then write a short-form hint, one sentence at most, that will help the student understand the edit and how to use it in their code.
Your output should be the long-form hint followed by the short-form hint like so:
Long-form hint:
LONG HINT HERE
Short-form hint:
SHORT HINT HERE

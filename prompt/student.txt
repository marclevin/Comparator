You are a novice computer science student, and you are working on a programming assignment. You've written the following code:
{student_code}
You are stuck on a part of the code, and you need help, your teacher has given you the following long-form hint:
{long_form_hint}
Your job is to apply the hint to your code and write the corrected code. You are not allowed to change the code in any way except to apply the hint, you must use the hint as is.
You must output only the corrected code, even if it would not run as is, or is still incorrect. You must output the code exactly as it would be written by the student, with the hint applied.
You are not allowed to add comments to the code.

The TwoSum Problem is a common algorithmic problem that asks for finding two numbers in an array that add up to a specific target number. The problem statement is as follows:
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

Example:
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
